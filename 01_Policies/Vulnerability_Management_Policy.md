# Vulnerability Management Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2025  
**Owner:** EcoMetricx InfoSec Team (Andrei Ionete - andrei@ecometricx.com)  
**Review Cycle:** Annually

## 1. Purpose

Establish requirements for identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in EcoMetricx systems and applications. Supports SOC 2 CC7.1 (System Monitoring) and CC7.2 (Incident Response).

## 2. Scope

- All EcoMetricx-managed systems and applications
- AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, Lambda, containers)
- Third-party software and dependencies
- Network devices and security controls
- Web applications and APIs

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment

### 3.1 Assessment Methods

| Method | Frequency | Scope |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Automated Vulnerability Scans | Weekly | All production systems |
| Dependency Scanning | Per build (CI/CD) | All applications |
| Penetration Testing | Annually | Critical systems |
| AWS Security Hub | Continuous | AWS resources |
| Manual Security Reviews | Quarterly | Configuration review |

### 3.2 Tools

- **AWS Security Hub:** Aggregated security findings
- **Amazon Inspector:** EC2 and container scanning
- **Dependabot/Snyk:** Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Manual Reviews:** CloudTrail, CloudWatch analysis

## 4. Vulnerability Classification

### 4.1 Severity Levels (CVSS-Based)

| Severity | CVSS Score | Remediation Timeline |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Within 24 hours |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Within 7 days |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Within 30 days |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Within 90 days |

### 4.2 Context Adjustments

Adjust timeline based on:
- **Data Classification:** Restricted data systems +1 severity
- **Internet Exposure:** Public-facing systems +1 severity
- **Active Exploitation:** Known exploited = Critical
- **Mitigating Controls:** Documented compensating controls may extend timeline

## 5. Remediation Process

### 5.1 Workflow

```
Discovery → Triage → Prioritize → Remediate → Verify → Document
```

### 5.2 Steps

1. **Discovery:** Vulnerability identified via scanning or notification
2. **Triage:** Validate, classify severity, assign owner
3. **Prioritize:** Based on severity, exposure, data classification
4. **Remediate:** Apply patch, configuration change, or compensating control
5. **Verify:** Re-scan to confirm remediation
6. **Document:** Record in vulnerability tracking system

### 5.3 Remediation Methods

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Patching | Software updates available |
| Configuration | Misconfiguration issues |
| Compensating Control | Patch not available, risk accepted |
| Isolation | High risk, cannot remediate immediately |
| Removal | Deprecated software/service |

## 6. Exception Process

### 6.1 Exception Criteria

Exceptions may be granted when:
- Patch causes system instability (documented)
- Business-critical system requires change window
- Compensating controls adequately mitigate risk

### 6.2 Exception Requirements

- [ ] Business justification documented
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Compensating controls identified
- [ ] Manager approval obtained
- [ ] Expiration date set (maximum 90 days)
- [ ] Exception tracked in Risk Register

### 6.3 Exception Limits

| Severity | Maximum Exception Period |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Critical | 7 days |
| High | 30 days |
| Medium | 90 days |
| Low | 180 days |

## 7. AWS-Specific Vulnerabilities

### 7.1 EC2 Instances

- Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning
- SSM Patch Manager for automated patching
- Security Groups review per audit findings

**Current Status (Dec 2025):**
- 11 EC2 instances
- Security groups audited (20 with 0.0.0.0/0 rules identified)

### 7.2 S3 Buckets

- S3 public access settings reviewed
- Encryption verified
- Bucket policies audited

**Current Status (Dec 2025):**
- 54 S3 buckets audited
- No public access detected

### 7.3 RDS Databases

- RDS security group restrictions
- Encryption at rest verified
- Public accessibility checked

**Current Status (Dec 2025):**
- 4 RDS instances audited
- 2 publicly accessible (require review)

### 7.4 Container Images

- ECR image scanning enabled
- Base image updates tracked
- CI/CD security scanning

## 8. Reporting

### 8.1 Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Critical Remediation Time | <24 hours | Average days to close |
| High Remediation Time | <7 days | Average days to close |
| Open Vulnerability Count | Decreasing trend | Monthly snapshot |
| Exception Count | <5 | Active exceptions |

### 8.2 Reports

- **Weekly:** Open vulnerabilities by severity
- **Monthly:** Remediation metrics, exception status
- **Quarterly:** Trend analysis, penetration test results

## 9. Threat Intelligence

### 9.1 Sources

- AWS Security Bulletins
- NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
- Vendor security advisories

### 9.2 Response to Zero-Day

When zero-day vulnerability announced:
1. Assess applicability to EcoMetricx systems
2. Implement compensating controls immediately
3. Monitor for exploitation attempts
4. Apply patch when available
5. Document timeline and actions

## 10. Responsibilities

### 10.1 InfoSec Team

- Manage vulnerability scanning program
- Triage and prioritize vulnerabilities
- Track remediation progress
- Report metrics to leadership

### 10.2 System Owners

- Remediate vulnerabilities within SLA
- Request exceptions when needed
- Verify remediation effectiveness

### 10.3 Development Teams

- Address code vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies
- Implement secure coding practices

## 11. Related Policies

- Information Security Policy
- Change Management Policy
- Incident Response Policy
- Access Control Policy

## 12. Compliance Mapping

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| SOC 2 | CC7.1 (System Monitoring) |
| ISO 27001 | A.12.6 (Technical Vulnerability Management) |
| NIST | SI-2 (Flaw Remediation) |
